# Task3-Bot-Integration

the third task, we were asked to make a chatbot on our website through https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant?cm_sp=Scheduler-_-CopyChng2-_-C and integrate it into our webpage. The bot is a little bit silly so don't mind me. I let the bot tell you about myself, Smart Methods, The project and why a summer internship is important. If you entered an odd word the bot will tell you it doesn't recognize it. You can also ask the bot about the date.

Thanks to the engineer Shaima Ahmed (Github: shaimadotcom ) for teaching us how to do it, she was patient with us and presented coherent steps. https://github.com/shaimadotcom
